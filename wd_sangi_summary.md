## Summary

This StoryMap visualizes my project from Weeks 7–9. The workflow included locating the raw data, exporting it, cleaning and reconciling the dataset, and finally transforming it into a visual map using ArcGIS.

## Reflection

This assignment helped me understand:

- How raw spatial data is structured
- Why cleaning and reconciling data is important before visualization
- How GitHub can be used to organize and document a multi-step project
- How maps communicate information through space, visuals, and narrative

Mapping the data made the project more understandable and meaningful, and helped me see the relationship between movement, location, and storytelling.
